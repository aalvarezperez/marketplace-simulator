"""Variant allocation: deterministic hash bucketing, pluggable randomization
designs, and an in-memory assignment store (the source of truth).

Allocation answers "which variant is unit U in for experiment E at time T?".
It is design-driven, looked up on demand, and cached. It is NOT exposure (the
action-consequence layer) and defines no treatment effect. The event stream is a
projection of the store, not the truth.

Self-contained: imports only stdlib + numpy, so sim.spec / sim.engine import it
without cycles.
